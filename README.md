This is the main android implementaion of the application. Input drivers for a few different hardware sensors can be found in the [input drivers repository](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard/inputdrivers).

## Installation

Before you can build and install the application, you have to install the [keyboard backend project](https://github.com/accessible-virtual-keyboard/backend).
